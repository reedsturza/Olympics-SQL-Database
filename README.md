# Olympics SQL Database

## How it works
this project uses a combination of Python and SQL to create a database for Olympic Sports and Medals from 1896 to 2014. The data is taken from 
https://www.kaggle.com/the-guardian/olympic-games. running main.py will create the database using the code from createDatabase.py. The tables are set up to separate winter
and summer games along with the individual events, medalists, and athletes. You can see the SQL code to create the tables in tables.sql. After main.py is run the user will be asked
which of the queries from queries.py they would like to run. Once a query is selected its output will be displayed to the user.
